# PortlandVertigoTheaterCodeSnippets
Code that I contributed to this project.

This was a website deisgned for a theater to use and easily add, delete, and update their upcoming shows.

Other pages on this site was created by other teammates. We all worked together to produce an easy to use website for clients.
